We are a movie studio, that produces various films.<br />
To make a film we need several things to happen:<br />
We need to allocate a budget for a film.<br />
We need a list of partners who provide various services:
<br />
Cast: provides people that take part in the movie - actors, directors, 
cinematographers, etc.
<br />
We need to be able to estimate the costs of making a movie:
Each team member charges a certain amount of money per hour and each movie has 
certain budget allocated.
<br />
We need to be able to estimate the time when the movie will be available in theaters:
Preproduction, production, and postproduction times can be estimated based on the 
script.
<br />
Each team member has availability since they might be involved in other projects.
Script provides data of the number of actors needed for a movie, filming locations and 
production times.<br />
Script already exists before film budget and timeline planning.
It is stored in separate object in Salesforce with following properties:
<br />
Period needed for production (like 20 days)<br />
Number of actors needed<br />
Locations <br />
<br />
We want to track financial information about by the movie â€“ revenue, budget, actor costs, 
that we receive in CSV format, and it needs to be updated on movie records.
<br />
We would like to have a catalog of movies and be able to search for movies by genre to 
make our work more efficient
