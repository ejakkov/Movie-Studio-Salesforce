We are a movie studio, that produces various films.
To make a film we need several things to happen:
We need to allocate a budget for a film.
We need a list of partners who provide various services:
Cast: provides people that take part in the movie - actors, directors, 
cinematographers, etc.
We need to be able to estimate the costs of making a movie:
Each team member charges a certain amount of money per hour and each movie has 
certain budget allocated.
We need to be able to estimate the time when the movie will be available in theaters:
Preproduction, production, and postproduction times can be estimated based on the 
script.
Each team member has availability since they might be involved in other projects.
Script provides data of the number of actors needed for a movie, filming locations and 
production times.
Script already exists before film budget and timeline planning.
It is stored in separate object in Salesforce with following properties:
Period needed for production (like 20 days)
Number of actors needed
Locations 
We want to track financial information about by the movie â€“ revenue, budget, actor costs, 
that we receive in CSV format, and it needs to be updated on movie records.
We would like to have a catalog of movies and be able to search for movies by genre to 
make our work more efficient
